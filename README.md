## Detail information about different pages of the website:

The website will have the following pages:

 1. ### Home/Landing page:
        one `header` with basic `navigation-bar`, one `banner` with `h1-text` and `description`. after this we can have any number of information in the form of `carousel`, `accordion` or in the `z-pattern` or `notice board` kind.
        After that we will have a `footer` with `site-map`, `qr-code` and other important information.
